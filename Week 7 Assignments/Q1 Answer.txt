Q.1 Answer:

The code block 1 would compare the addresses(name == "Q") and not the values as we are comparing two object types and not primitive values, so in this case we will get false as return value.

1.	public boolean IsNameQ() {
		String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
		return (name == "Q");
	}

	
The code block 2 would return true, as here we are comparing 2 primitive data types and not objects, here the values would be compared and if the values are same, we will get true as the return value.

2.	public boolean IsNameQ() {
		String name = readLine("Enter name: ");
		char ch = name.charAt(0);
		return ((ch == 'Q') && (name.length() == 1));
	}
